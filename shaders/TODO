Atmospheric fog changes based on biome
Custom nether fog falloff

Add option to change between Custom / vanilla / vanilla without old lighting

No backface rendering, use normals to determine shadow validity

Light opaque stuff on deferred pass and use composite to get shadows on transparent objects
OR
find out if you can sample shadow textures in gbuffers

Re-add night effect

PROPER SHADOW LEAKING FIX (instead of just removing shadows if there's no sky light)
Transfer all of this to the trello page (and link it here once the repo becomes public)

lower LUT temperature
Different LUTs per dimension

Geometry shaders to scale up block faces to fix shadow leak
iris compatibility
Render transparent shadows in gbuffers using texture2D instead of texture
Use render stage uniform to detect before/after deferred
Stop using mul_m4_v3
Add in/out to all function declarations
Shadow leak fix by sampling adjacent pixels
Transluscent stuff less affected by shadows?
Fix nametags
Nighttime mask for blue grading
Fix clouds
Underwater effects
Jitter everything in vsh for Temporal Super-Resolution
Remove moon/sun when underground
Dithering for color transitions, especially sky

Idea: seasons?
Idea: render at 1/2 resolution and fill in gaps with texpix rendering

Foveated Rendering
Add reveal light cloning
Improve makeCells() (create more square-ish cells)
Cool lightning effects
Optimize cell function
Use cubemap for reflections and GI
Implement gaussian and bilateral blur
Add texpix support for rotated faces
Add stereoscopic rendering (3D effect)
Add base files for compute shaders
GI reverse sampling using 'coherent'?
Add fresnel

continuous TODO:s
Use fma wherever possible
use in/out for functions
add cycle counts to functions
reduce branching
