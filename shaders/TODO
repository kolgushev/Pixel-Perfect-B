Add bedrockLevel-based void fog

Make the noise texture a 3D file

allow LUTs to output in any colorspace
add rec.2100 PQ colorspaces

Ores glow, but only when close

Atmospheric fog changes based on biome

No backface rendering, use normals to determine shadow validity

Re-add night effect

PROPER SHADOW LEAKING FIX (instead of just removing shadows if there's no sky light)
Transfer all of this to the trello page (and link it here once the repo becomes public)

Different LUTs per dimension

Geometry shaders to scale up block faces to fix shadow leak
Render transparent shadows in gbuffers using texture2D instead of texture
Use render stage uniform to detect before/after deferred
Stop using mul_m4_v3
Add in/out to all function declarations
Shadow leak fix by sampling adjacent pixels
Fix nametags
Nighttime mask for blue grading
Jitter everything in vsh for Temporal Super-Resolution
Remove moon/sun when underground
Dithering for color transitions, especially sky

Idea: seasons?
Idea: render at 1/2 resolution and fill in gaps with texpix rendering

Foveated Rendering
Add reveal light cloning
Improve makeCells() (create more square-ish cells)
Cool lightning effects
Optimize cell function
Use cubemap for reflections and GI
Implement gaussian and bilateral blur
Add texpix support for rotated faces
Add stereoscopic rendering (3D effect)
Add base files for compute shaders
GI reverse sampling using 'coherent'?
Add fresnel

continuous TODO:s
use in/out for functions
add cycle counts to functions
reduce branching


## Roadmap
This shader is currently in development, meaning it is still being tweaked and new features are still being developed. The next few releases aim to:
- Add antialiasing
- Overhaul performance
  - Currently, the shading for a pixel is often re-calculated multiple times, slowing down the shader. Once fixed, performance should significantly improve.
- Add several common effects missing from this shader, including:
  - Screen Space Reflections
  - Wavy Water
  - Screen Space Ambient Occlusion
  - Bloom
  - Motion blur
  - Depth of Field
- Improve the End Dimension visuals
