Light opaque stuff on deferred pass and use composite to get shadows on transparent objects
OR
find out if you can sample shadow textures in gbuffers

turn off shadow backface rendering

Transfer all of this to the trello page (and link it here once the repo becomes public)

Stop using mul_m4_v3
Add in/out to all function declarations
Shadow leak fix by storing normal data
Nighttime mask for blue grading
Fix clouds
Underwater effects
Jitter everything in vsh for Temporal Super-Resolution
Remove moon/sun when underground
Dithering for color transitions, especially sky

Idea: seasons?
Idea: render at 1/2 resolution and fill in gaps with texpix rendering

Foveated Rendering
Add reveal light cloning
Improve makeCells() (create more square-ish cells)
Cool lightning effects
Optimize cell function
Use cubemap for reflections and GI
Implement gaussian and bilateral blur
Add texpix support for rotated faces
Add stereoscopic rendering (3D effect)
Add base files for compute shaders
GI reverse sampling using 'coherent'?
Add fresnel

continuous TODO:s
Use fma wherever possible
use in/out for functions
add cycle counts to functions
reduce branching
