# How to use LUTs with this shader

Make sure you can see file extensions before following these steps. To see file extensions in Windows file explorer, click `View > Show > File name extensions`.

If you have a raw lookup table with the `cube` extension (example: `LookupTable.cube` or `LookupTable.CUBE`), do the following:

1. Place the file in this folder
2. Run the `convert.py` program in the same folder
3. If it wasn't already there, you should see a `lut.png`. If something went wrong, an `error.md` file describing the problem should appear. If no files appear, the program crashed.
5. If the `lut.png` file does appear, the LUT should be correctly applied.

*NOTE: Some LUTs are copyrighted or licensed, so make sure to follow applicable law when redistributing converted files.*
